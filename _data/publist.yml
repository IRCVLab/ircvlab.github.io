  # description: SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. We have sequenced both genomic and subgenomic RNAs to understand the transcriptional landscape of the viral activities. Two complementary techniques were adopted for this study. [DNA nanoball sequencing](https://www.bgi.com/us/dnbseq-ngs-technology/) shows that the transcriptome is highly complex, owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and frameshift in addition to the canonical genomic and nine subgenomic RNAs. Using [nanopore direct RNA sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4577), we mapped the primary structures of full-length subgenomic RNAs with discontinuities. The relatively new technique also enables the analysis of RNA modifications. We found frequent modifications that are specific to a subset of viral RNAs. Functional investigation of the unknown transcripts and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.
